### 📜 Commit Message Rules Guide  

This document explains how to write structured commit messages using **commitlint** and the **Conventional Commits** standard.

---

## 🔹 **Commit Message Format**  
A valid commit message must follow this format:  
```plaintext
<type>: <description>
```
### ✅ **Examples**
```
feat: Add login authentication  
fix: Resolve database connection issue  
docs: Update README with API details  
```
---

## 🔹 **Allowed Commit Types**  
Each commit must start with a **valid type**:  

| Type       | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `feat`     | A new feature |
| `fix`      | A bug fix |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes (README, comments, etc.) |
| `style`    | Code formatting (spaces, indentation, no logic change) |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring (no bug fixes or features) |
| `perf`     | Performance improvements |
| `test`     | Adding/modifying tests |
| `build`    | Changes in build tools, dependencies, etc. |
| `ci`       | CI/CD pipeline changes |
| `chore`    | Maintenance (e.g., updating dependencies) |
| `revert`   | Reverting a previous commit |

🚫 **Invalid Commits (Blocked)**  
```
update: Improve performance  ❌ (not an allowed type)  
change: Refactor login logic  ❌ (not an allowed type)  
```
---

## 🔹 **Subject Formatting Rules**
✅ **Do**:  
✔ Use **sentence case** (capitalize first word, lowercase rest)  
✔ Keep the message **short and clear** (max 72 characters)  

🚫 **Don't**:  
❌ Use **lowercase** for the first letter (`feat: improve performance`)  
❌ Use **all caps** (`feat: IMPROVE PERFORMANCE`)  
❌ End with a **period** (`fix: Resolve cache issue.`)  

---

## 🔹 **Why Follow These Rules?**
✔ Makes commit history **consistent & readable**  
✔ Helps in **automated versioning & changelogs**  
✔ Enforces **best practices** for team collaboration

By following these rules, your commits will be **clean, structured, and useful**! 🚀
